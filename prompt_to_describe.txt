Your job is to come up with title and description for a music video. There is @./sample.mp3 - sample, the final version will be much longer but of similar type. The visual is at @./sample.jpg - a still image to go with the audio. 

Your top priority is discoverability. Think about possible searches that people interested in such long-form music would look for.

The title must be catchy but related.

The description must not be overly verbose and shouldn't use emoji. It should hit keywords that people interested in such music will search for.
