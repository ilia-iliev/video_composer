Your job is to come up with title and description for a music video. There is @sample.mp3 - this is the sample music, the final version will be longer and have different tracks. The visual is at @sample.jpg - a still image to go with the audio. 

Your top priority is discoverability. Think about possible searches that people interested in such long-form music would look for. Here are some searches that were popular with previous videos. Please use them for reference only and focus on expanding reach instead of re-iterating previous matches:
- dnd combat music
- epic drums

The title must be catchy but related.

The description must NOT BE verbose. Straight to the point, short sentences and no repetition. However, it should hit keywords that people interested in such music will search for. Also, no emojis!
